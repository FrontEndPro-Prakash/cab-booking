					<h2 class="page-heading page-headingBorder">Privacy Policy</h2>	
					<p>This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how we treat information you may provide to us, including how we may use such information, how we protect the security of such information, and how you may change or request that we remove such information from our systems. This includes any information associated directly with you (such as your name, title, email address or phone number) that is supplied to us in conjunction with your use or potential use of our website and/or easyBiodata’s permission-based online account spaces, known as the easyBiodata platform or easybiodataTM Exchanges (the “Service”).</p>
					<p>easyBiodata reserves the right to disclose, sell, rent, or otherwise provide to any third party any personally identifiable information collected through this website or the Service. easyBiodata may or may not necessarily execute use of this right.</p>	
					<p>Please note our website includes hyperlinks to other websites neither owned nor managed by us. easyBiodata is not associated with these third-party websites and does not review their privacy policies. We cannot guarantee the privacy of any information that may be obtained by third parties at these other websites. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any website you visit before supplying personally identifiable information through that website.</p>	
					<h4 class="page-sub-heading">What information does easyBiodata collect through its public website, and how is this information used?</h4>					
					<p>easyBiodata collects certain personally identifiable information through its website when you choose to submit such information to us through email, an online form, or other method. You may provide easyBiodata with information in order to request additional information about the Service, employment opportunities, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. We also collect information about website users through temporary “Cookies” (for further information about Cookies, please see below) used to facilitate completion of online forms and other communications through the website. By providing this information, using the website or any of these communication tools, you consent to easybiodata’s use of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<p>easyBiodata also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to this website, including but not limited to a visitor’s IP address (a computer’s numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access the website, the type of web browsers used to access the website, and the pages viewed.</p>
					<p>We may use information collected through our website to respond to specific requests for information about our services and other inquiries. We may also use your information to inform you about other easybiodata’s services that might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our services. If you decide to purchase our services, we may use your information for purposes of providing such services to you.</p>
					<h4 class="page-sub-heading">What information does easyBiodata collect about users of its permissioned-based Service and how is this information used?</h4>
					<p>This section applies to users of the easyBiodata Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. The Service is an Internet-based hosted platform designed to enable family and friend communities to share information through the platform. In this Privacy Policy, an “Exchange” means a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information relating to a specific candidate’s Biodata or account space. The manager of an Exchange, or your consultant or an affiliate or partner of your consultant, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange will provide certain information about you, such as your name, affiliation, email address and telephone number. Using this information, we will provide you with a user ID and temporary password to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below.</p>
					<p>When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with the “profile”, which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the contact information in the profile. By providing, updating, or accepting your contact information in your profile, you consent to our use of such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to consent to our use of your contact information, you will not be allowed to use the Service and should not agree to this Privacy Policy and the user agreement presented at the time you first log on.</p>
					<p>Once your contact information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) may then have access to your contact information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.</p>
					<p>Your contact information is also added to easyBiodata’s global directory of current and former users of the Service. If you are selected to join another Exchange in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your contact information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more “groups,” which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges that they have managed. Your contact information may be added to one or more of these groups.</p>
					<p>We may use your contact information to contact you regarding your and/or your families’ use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service. You may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange.As a function of the Service, easybiodata also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g., access to Biodata and comments, searches). easybiodata also may maintain a log of users’ IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser’s settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as “Usage Log Information”.</p>
					<p>In addition, as the global directory is an asset of easybiodata, if easyBiodata were sold to or merged with another company, the global directory (which includes your contact information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of easyBiodata, who agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request that your contact information be removed from the global directory at any time (see below).</p>
					<h4 class="page-sub-heading">How does easybiodata protect the security of the information I provide?</h4>
					<p>We consider any information provided by you through our website to be confidential, unless it is publicly available or has already been provided to us without any confidentiality restriction. easyBiodata takes appropriate and reasonable precautions and has implemented appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of information provided through its website and Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use information you provide only to serve legitimate business and service needs consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, easyBiodata may disclose business contact information and other information collected about you (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule or other legal process; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person’s health or property.</p>					
					<h4 class="page-sub-heading">How can I change, update, or delete my contact and other profile information, or request that I not be contacted for 
non-support purposes?</h4>
					<p>You can change or update your contact information at any time, regardless of whether you are a current or former user of the Service, by logging into the Service with your user ID and password and accessing your My Account page.</p>
					<p>You may request that we remove your contact information from our global directory. However, by doing so, you will automatically lose all access rights to the Service. You may have your contact information removed from the easybiodata global directory by emailing us at info@easyBiodata.com. Please note that your contact information may be re-added to the global directory in the future if you are asked to participate in another Exchange, as described above.</p>
					<p>You also may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange. If you wish to be added to our “support-only” contact list at any time, please email us at info@easyBiodata.com.</p>					
					<h4 class="page-sub-heading">Does easyBiodata use "Cookies"?</h4>
					<p>“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive.

This Cookie enables you to enter an Exchange throughout your current working session and will remain on your computer until you log out of that Exchange or you close your web browser. If your browser is set not to accept Cookies, you will not be able to sign into and/or use the Service. Again, these Cookies are temporary and are not used for tracking your behavior within or outside of the Service. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not use Cookies in conjunction with the Service.</p>
					<p>Also, third party companies under agreement with us may deploy Cookies or similar technologies to collect and assemble non-personal and technical information from our users (collectively, “Audience Cookies”). Such Audience Cookies, which do not identify you personally, may be placed when you access our websites or others under contract with these third parties. We and these third parties may use such non-personally identifiable information in combination with your visits in order to present advertisements about easyBiodata services likely to be of interest to you.
